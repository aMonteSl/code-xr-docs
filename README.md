# CodeXR: Code analysis you can walk through

![The CodeXR room: the dependency graph on the pedestal table, two participants with name tags, the in-room guide and a shared virtual screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/hero.png)

CodeXR is a Visual Studio Code extension that analyzes your code (complexity, size, structure, dependencies, history) and turns the numbers into something you can actually look at: a 3D scene served locally and opened **in the browser you already have**. Walk around your codebase like a city, watch it update live as you edit, compare two points of its Git history side by side, or replay its whole evolution as a film.

**No VR headset required.** Everything works on a normal desktop with mouse and keyboard, and the 2D LivePanel mode doesn't even leave VS Code. If you do have a headset, the same scene becomes immersive. That's the XR in CodeXR: an extra dimension when you want it, never a requirement.

Everything runs on your machine: local analysis, local servers, no telemetry, no account, and nothing is downloaded without asking you first.

## What's New in v1.2.0: "Threads, Timelines & Global Networks"

**Threads** are the new dependency graph: the lines that tie your codebase together. **Timelines** are the two Git analyses: compare two points in your project's history, or replay the whole thing as a film. **Global Networks** are the sessions you can now open to someone who is not on your network at all.

One analysis table now serves **four analyses**, and you switch between them from inside the scene without losing the state of any of them.

### Classic analysis, sharper and live

The city you know, now on a rebuilt table: one building per file, sized and coloured by the metrics you choose. Every chart type (bars, cylinders, pie, donut, bubbles, boats and more) now presents correctly and can be changed live from the Field Mapping panel, big projects stay readable by showing the top files per metric, and any change you save in the editor updates the scene by itself.

![Classic analysis demo: the boats city, live chart switching from the Field Mapping panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/videos/normal/normal_analysis_demo.gif)

| **The result**: the city on its table, with the guide and your editor around it | **The panel**: pick the chart, then the metric that drives area, height and colour |

▶ **[Watch the full demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/76p1ibPaf3I)**

### Dependency graph: see the architecture, not just the files

A new analysis that answers *what depends on what, and what happens if I touch this*. Relations are extracted statically from your working directory across the supported languages, and rendered as a navigable 3D graph with three layouts: `force-3d`, `hierarchical` and `metric-space` with real axes. Any node metric (fan-in, fan-out, cycle size, blast radius…) can drive size, height, colour or position, so *"the thing that breaks the most if you touch it"* becomes something you see across the room. Click a node to pin its metric card; large projects open in group view and you drill in.

| **The result**: pin a node and read its coupling, its cycle and its blast radius | **The panel**: choose the layout, map the metrics and filter which relations are drawn |

▶ **[Watch the full demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/42hIQTUD0-g)**

### Historical comparison: what changed between two points in time

Pick two sources (working copy, branch, tag or commit) and CodeXR puts both states on one dual table, same chart, same mapping, same scale, so a height difference is a real difference. A comparison card reports added / removed / modified counts and per-metric deltas. It never runs `checkout` or `fetch` and never writes inside `.git`: your branch, index and files stay exactly where you left them.

![Historical comparison demo: two revisions of the same project, side by side](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/videos/historical/historical_comparison_demo.gif)

|:---:|:---:|
| ![The dual table: the working copy on the left and an older revision on the right, both labelled, on one shared scale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/analysis/xr/historical/historical_comparison_example.png) | ![The comparison panel: the LEFT and RIGHT source slots, filters for branches, tags, commits and merges, and the Compare button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/controllers/xr/historical/historical_comparison_main.png) |
| **The result**: both revisions side by side, each with its own label and date | **The panel**: choose what goes on the left and on the right, then compare |

▶ **[Watch the full demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/b37qDCQeZg0)**

### Project Evolution: your Git history as a film

Where the comparison shows two photographs, Project Evolution plays the movie: the chart walks the project's own history, commit by commit, from the first revision to the current state of the branch. The timeline is sampled evenly in time (favouring merges and tags), or you pick a range, or exactly the commits you want. Play, pause, step, change speed, jump anywhere. Every frame is a full analysis, labelled with its commit and date.

![Project Evolution demo: the city rising and reorganising through the project's commits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/videos/project_evolution/project_evolution_demo.gif)

### And the rest of 1.2.0

- **Collaboration 2.0**: persistent identities, host/guest roles with automatic promotion, and a bundled animated avatar (CC0, works offline) with a per-participant colour and a name tag that always faces you.
- **Cross-network sessions, optional and off by default**: share a session with someone outside your network through an outbound Cloudflare tunnel: no router changes, no published IP, a six-digit pairing code that expires and burns itself on a wrong attempt, and full revocation the moment you stop sharing.
- **Screen sharing that survives the trip**: guests arriving through the tunnel are served by your own CodeXR server; one encode for the whole audience, quality that follows the audience size.
- **An in-room user guide**: six colour-coded tabs plus a 24-term metric glossary generated from the real analysis contracts, also served as `guide.html` for reading outside XR.
- **LivePanel grows two sections**: *Dependency Summary* (counters, top fan-in/fan-out, cycles) and *Historical Comparison* in 2D with a searchable delta table.
- **A reorganized sidebar**: servers, collaboration and remote access in one place, readable native dialogs, and the whole UI in English.
- **The in-scene analysis selector**: a proper `Analyses` button that wears the colour of the analysis you are in:

![The analysis selector panel with the four colour-coded analyses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/controllers/xr/analysis_selector/analysis_selector.png)

The complete list, including a long round of chart, containment and collaboration fixes, is in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Tested in real XR sessions

You don't have to take the immersive mode on faith. This release's VR and AR experience was driven and debugged **end to end inside real WebXR sessions**, emulated from a desktop browser with Meta's [Immersive Web Emulator](https://github.com/meta-quest/immersive-web-emulator): entry height and positioning, stick locomotion and flight, laser aim and hand switching, what AR hides and keeps, AR lighting, and grabbing screens with the controller. The screenshots below come straight from those test sessions. Where you see extra panels and RGB gizmos around the controllers, that is the emulator's own tooling, not CodeXR.

Want to reproduce it (or validate on your own headset)? The [WebXR emulator tutorial](docs/xr-testing/WEBXR_EMULATOR_TUTORIAL.md) explains the setup and the [manual VR/AR checklist](docs/xr-testing/XR_MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md) is the validation script.

- **Left thumbstick**: Move fluidly, toward where you are looking. In VR and AR you fly: look up and push forward to rise over the city, look down to descend
- **Right thumbstick**: Turn smoothly
- **Trigger**: Point and click, with either hand; the pointer follows whichever controller you last used
- **Gaze**: Before any controller connects, a reticle lets you point with your head

> Controller support is implemented through standard A-Frame/WebXR bindings, but this release has not been validated on physical headset hardware. See [Feedback](#support-feedback--community) below.

## Managing Active Analyses

The **"Active Analyses"** section in the tree view provides comprehensive session management:

- **View Status**: See which files, directories, or projects are currently being analyzed
- **Prevent Duplicates**: Automatically prevents multiple analyses of the same target
- **Left-Click Action Menu**: Click any active analysis to open its action menu with details, browser access, export, and close options
- **Easy Cleanup**: Close analyses you no longer need to free system resources
- **Session Details**: View detailed information about each active analysis
- **Browser Integration**: Open analyses directly in your browser
- **Export for Debugging**: Copy the full generated analysis folder to any location for manual inspection or debugging

## Configuration and Customization

## Performance Tips & Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- **Large Files**: Increase debounce delay for files over 1000 lines
- **Resource Management**: Close unused analyses to free system resources
- **Directory Analysis**: Use standard mode first, then deep mode for comprehensive analysis
- **Multiple Projects**: Use LivePanel mode for quick analysis, XR for deep exploration

### VR/AR Best Practices (if you use a headset)
- **AR Mode**: Use on mobile devices or AR headsets for best experience
- **VR Navigation**: Take breaks during long analysis sessions to prevent fatigue
- **Controller Setup**: Ensure controllers are charged before starting VR sessions, and please report any controller issue you hit, since this release could not be validated on physical hardware
- **Lighting**: Ensure adequate room lighting for AR tracking
- **Validate without a headset**: the whole immersive experience can be exercised from a desktop browser with Meta's Immersive Web Emulator. See the [emulator tutorial](docs/xr-testing/WEBXR_EMULATOR_TUTORIAL.md) and the [manual VR/AR checklist](docs/xr-testing/XR_MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md)

### Analysis Workflow
1. **Start with LivePanel**: Get overview with LivePanel analysis
2. **Explore in 3D**: Open the XR mode in your browser for spatial exploration of complex code
3. **Use Active Analyses**: Monitor all open visualizations from tree view
4. **Configure Settings**: Adjust debounce timing based on your coding style
5. **Directory Analysis**: Start with standard mode, use deep mode for comprehensive coverage

## Support, Feedback & Community

### A note on VR hardware

This release was validated on desktop browsers, through CodeXR's automated test suites (unit tests, Python analysis suites and browser harnesses), **and end to end on emulated WebXR sessions** using Meta's [Immersive Web Emulator](https://github.com/meta-quest/immersive-web-emulator). That emulator is what let us find and fix real immersive bugs before shipping: entry height and positioning, what AR hides and keeps (environment, room walls, invisible colliders), stick locomotion and flight, laser aim and hand switching, AR lighting, and grabbing screens with the controller. It still **could not be tested on a physical VR headset**: everything is built on standard WebXR/A-Frame bindings and should work, so if you run CodeXR on real hardware and anything misbehaves (the [manual VR/AR checklist](docs/xr-testing/XR_MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md) is a good script to follow), **please [open an issue](https://github.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/issues)**: a device name and a couple of lines about what went wrong are enough, and every report directly improves the next release.
