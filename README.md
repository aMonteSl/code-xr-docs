# CodeXR: Code analysis you can walk through

![The CodeXR room: the dependency graph on the pedestal table, two participants with name tags, the in-room guide and a shared virtual screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/hero.png)

CodeXR is a Visual Studio Code extension that analyzes your code (complexity, size, structure, dependencies, history) and turns the numbers into something you can actually look at: a 3D scene served locally and opened **in the browser you already have**. Walk around your codebase like a city, watch it update live as you edit, compare two points of its Git history side by side, or replay its whole evolution as a film.

**No VR headset required.** Everything works on a normal desktop with mouse and keyboard, and the 2D LivePanel mode doesn't even leave VS Code. If you do have a headset, the same scene becomes immersive. That's the XR in CodeXR: an extra dimension when you want it, never a requirement.

Everything runs on your machine: local analysis, local servers, no telemetry, no account, and nothing is downloaded without asking you first (your answer is remembered, so you are asked once).

### Tried on three real projects

Not on toy fixtures. These are silent walkthroughs of the four analyses on three real, public codebases, the same three used to test every release.

**BabiaXR** ([aframe-babia-components](https://github.com/babiaxr/aframe-babia-components)), the A-Frame library CodeXR renders its charts with, so the code being measured is the code drawing the scene. [Watch the walkthrough](https://youtu.be/ZJo2eFBEPKA)

![BabiaXR analyzed with CodeXR: the four analyses on the aframe-babia-components repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/videos/testedProjects/BabiaXR/BabiaXR.gif)

**Express** ([expressjs/express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)), a small core with a very long history, which makes fan-in obvious and the evolution movie long. [Watch the walkthrough](https://youtu.be/ExHQhj6ibWU)

![Express analyzed with CodeXR: the four analyses on the expressjs/express repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/videos/testedProjects/ExpressJS/ExpressJS.gif)

**JetUML** ([prmr/JetUML](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML)), a Java desktop application whose deliberate package layering is exactly what the dependency graph is for. [Watch the walkthrough](https://youtu.be/Wy0T7dR2F-k)

![JetUML analyzed with CodeXR: the four analyses on the prmr/JetUML repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/videos/testedProjects/JetUML/JetUML.gif)

Every video on the channel, with its GIF and duration, is listed in [media/v1.2.0/videos/VIDEOS.md](media/v1.2.0/videos/VIDEOS.md).

## What's New in v1.2.0: "Threads, Timelines & Global Networks"

**Threads** are the new dependency graph: the lines that tie your codebase together. **Timelines** are the two Git analyses: compare two points in your project's history, or replay the whole thing as a film. **Global Networks** are the sessions you can now open to someone who is not on your network at all.

One analysis table now serves **four analyses**, and you switch between them from inside the scene without losing the state of any of them.

### Classic analysis, sharper and live

The city you know, now on a rebuilt table: one building per file, sized and coloured by the metrics you choose. Every chart type (bars, cylinders, pie, donut, bubbles, boats and more) now presents correctly and can be changed live from the Field Mapping panel, big projects stay readable by showing the top files per metric, and any change you save in the editor updates the scene by itself.

![Classic analysis demo: the boats city, live chart switching from the Field Mapping panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/videos/normal/normal_analysis_demo.gif)

| **The result**: the city on its table, with the guide and your editor around it | **The panel**: pick the chart, then the metric that drives area, height and colour |

▶ **[Watch the full demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/76p1ibPaf3I)**

### Dependency graph: see the architecture, not just the files

A new analysis that answers *what depends on what, and what happens if I touch this*. Relations are extracted statically from your working directory across the supported languages, and rendered as a navigable 3D graph with three layouts: `force-3d`, `hierarchical` and `metric-space` with real axes. Any node metric (fan-in, fan-out, cycle size, blast radius…) can drive size, height, colour or position, so *"the thing that breaks the most if you touch it"* becomes something you see across the room. Click a node to pin its metric card; large projects open in group view and you drill in.

| **The result**: pin a node and read its coupling, its cycle and its blast radius | **The panel**: choose the layout, map the metrics and filter which relations are drawn |

▶ **[Watch the full demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/42hIQTUD0-g)**

### Historical comparison: what changed between two points in time

Pick two sources (working copy, branch, tag or commit) and CodeXR puts both states on one dual table, same chart, same mapping, same scale, so a height difference is a real difference. A comparison card reports added / removed / modified counts and per-metric deltas. It never runs `checkout` or `fetch` and never writes inside `.git`: your branch, index and files stay exactly where you left them.

| **The result**: both revisions side by side, each with its own label and date | **The panel**: choose what goes on the left and on the right, then compare |

▶ **[Watch the full demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/b37qDCQeZg0)**

### Project Evolution: your Git history as a film

Where the comparison shows two photographs, Project Evolution plays the movie: the chart walks the project's own history, commit by commit, from the first revision to the current state of the branch. The timeline is sampled evenly in time (favouring merges and tags), or you pick a range, or exactly the commits you want. Play, pause, step, change speed, jump anywhere. Every frame is a full analysis, labelled with its commit and date.

### And the rest of 1.2.0

- **Collaboration 2.0**: persistent identities, host/guest roles with automatic promotion, and a bundled animated avatar (CC0, works offline) with a per-participant colour and a name tag that always faces you.
- **Cross-network sessions, ready out of the box**: every server you start opens an outbound Cloudflare tunnel automatically, so sharing with someone outside your network is one link away: no router changes, no published IP, a six-digit pairing code that burns itself on a wrong attempt, and full revocation the moment you stop sharing. The invitation link stays valid for as long as you keep sharing, and the whole capability can be turned off in Server Configuration.
- **Screen sharing that survives the trip**: guests arriving through the tunnel are served by your own CodeXR server; one encode for the whole audience, quality that follows the audience size.
- **An in-room user guide**: six colour-coded tabs plus a 24-term metric glossary generated from the real analysis contracts, also served as `guide.html` for reading outside XR.
- **LivePanel grows two sections**: *Dependency Summary* (counters, top fan-in/fan-out, cycles) and *Historical Comparison* in 2D with a searchable delta table.
- **A reorganized sidebar**: servers, collaboration and remote access in one place, readable native dialogs, and the whole UI in English.
- **The in-scene analysis selector**: a proper `Analyses` button that wears the colour of the analysis you are in:

![The analysis selector panel with the four colour-coded analyses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/controllers/xr/analysis_selector/analysis_selector.png)

The complete list, including a long round of chart, containment and collaboration fixes, is in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Tutorial: sharing a session across networks

A VR session over your own network needs none of this: a headset on the same Wi-Fi opens the scene directly. Cross-network access exists for the other case, someone who is **not** on your network. It is enabled by default (turn it off in Server Configuration if you prefer): `cloudflared` opens an **outbound** tunnel, so your router never has to accept an incoming connection and your IP is never published, and nobody enters without the code you read out.

The whole point of the flow below is that a link alone is never enough to get in. Whoever opens it still has to receive a code from you, through a channel you already trust.

Two people are involved, and each step below says which one acts: the **host** runs the analysis in VS Code and owns the session, and the **guest** joins from a browser anywhere in the world.

### 1. Host: start the server, the tunnel follows

Cross-network connections are enabled by default, so when your analysis server starts, CodeXR opens the tunnel with it (the first time it will offer to download `cloudflared`, once). The sidebar shows the **Cross-network address**, the `trycloudflare.com` invitation link, which also lands on your clipboard; the link stays valid for as long as you keep sharing. If you stopped the connection, **Start remote access** on the server row brings it back. Send the link to your guest however you normally talk to them.

![The CodeXR sidebar with the cross-network address on a trycloudflare.com link, plus View remote status and Stop remote connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/collaboration/host_user/control_panel.png)

Right below it sit **View remote status** and **Stop remote connection**, and further down the list of connected users, so the whole session lives in one place.

### 2. Guest: pick how you will appear

The link opens this page. Continue as anonymous, with an alias CodeXR reserves for you, or type a custom name of 2 to 32 characters. Then press **Request access**, which puts you in the waiting room: no code, no entry.

| | |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![The join page: continue as anonymous with a reserved alias, or choose a custom display name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/collaboration/invited_user/remote-join-identity.png) | ![The same page after requesting access: a six-digit field and a Connect button, waiting for the host's code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/collaboration/invited_user/remote-join-code.png) |
| **Step 1**: how you appear in the room | **Step 2**: waiting for the code the host reads out |

### 3. Host: read them the code

The moment the guest requests access, VS Code shows you the code with a **Copy code** button:

![VS Code notification reading "Remote request from Anakin. Temporary code: 957797", with a Copy code button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/collaboration/host_user/user_code.png)

The sidebar reflects the same thing, so a dismissed notification is never a dead end: the connection row reads **1 request waiting** and a **Generate new pairing code** action appears next to it.

![The sidebar showing "Cross-network connection · Shared | 1 request waiting" and the Generate new pairing code action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/collaboration/host_user/waiting_invited_user.png)

Pass those six digits to your guest through whatever channel you already use, a call or a message. **Guest**: type them, press **Connect**, and you are in the session.

### 4. If the code fails, the host issues a new one

A wrong code is burnt immediately on the server, so it can never be retried. The host gets a warning naming the guest and their address, with a **Generate new code** button that mints a fresh one on the spot, and the same **Generate new pairing code** action stays in the sidebar. There is no limit to how many times you can do this. If instead the guest runs out of attempts, the pairing request itself is over and they need a brand new invitation link.

| | |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![The join page rejecting a code: the field is cleared and a red message reads "The code is not valid"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/collaboration/invited_user/remote-join-rejected.png) | ![An invitation that no longer works: "This invitation has expired or was already used. Ask the host for a new link."](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/collaboration/invited_user/remote-join-expired.png) |
| **A burnt code**: the guest is told to ask for a new one | **A dead link**: expired or already used, so it needs a new invitation |

### 5. Host: stay in control of the room

**Connected users** lists everyone in the session, and each row states how they got there, so a guest who came through the tunnel is never confused with someone on your own network:

![Connected users (2): Anakin as Azure, CodeXR, Local; and Anakin 2 as Amber, Browser, Remote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/v1.2.0/media/v1.2.0/collaboration/host_user/control_host_users.png)

Click any of them to open their card: display name, role, avatar, when they connected, whether they arrived through the tunnel or from your local network, and the IP address they connected from. Guests carry a **Remove from Session** action; the host cannot be removed.

Removing a remote guest also revokes their session, so the link they have stops working and they need both a new invitation and a new code to come back. Someone on your local network can still reopen the server address, since nothing is gating that beyond the server itself, so stop the server if that is what you want. Either way the person sees a message telling them they were removed rather than the session dying on them.

**Stop remote connection** ends everything at once: invitations, sessions and credentials are revoked, and the random `trycloudflare.com` address simply stops existing.

> The tunnel is a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel: free, no account, and explicitly best effort. It has no SLA, it does not support Server-Sent Events, and the address changes every time. `cloudflared` is pinned to version 2026.5.2, downloaded only with your consent and checked against its SHA-256 before it ever runs. The full picture is in [the cross-network access document](docs/features/CLOUDFLARE_REMOTE_ACCESS.md).

## Tested in real XR sessions

You don't have to take the immersive mode on faith. This release's VR and AR experience was driven and debugged **end to end inside real WebXR sessions**, emulated from a desktop browser with Meta's [Immersive Web Emulator](https://github.com/meta-quest/immersive-web-emulator): entry height and positioning, stick locomotion and flight, laser aim and hand switching, what AR hides and keeps, AR lighting, and grabbing screens with the controller. The screenshots below come straight from those test sessions. Where you see extra panels and RGB gizmos around the controllers, that is the emulator's own tooling, not CodeXR.

Want to reproduce it (or validate on your own headset)? The [WebXR emulator tutorial](docs/xr-testing/WEBXR_EMULATOR_TUTORIAL.md) explains the setup and the [manual VR/AR checklist](docs/xr-testing/XR_MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md) is the validation script.

The standard VR scheme, driven by A-Frame's native controls:
- **Left thumbstick**: Move fluidly, toward where you are looking. In VR and AR you fly: look up and push forward to rise over the city, look down to descend
- **Right thumbstick**: Turn smoothly
- **Trigger**: Point and click, with either hand; the pointer follows whichever controller you last used
- **Gaze**: Before any controller connects, a reticle lets you point with your head

> Controller support is implemented through standard A-Frame/WebXR bindings, but this release has not been validated on physical headset hardware. See [Feedback](#support-feedback--community) below.

## Managing Active Analyses

The **"Active Analyses"** section in the tree view provides comprehensive session management:

- **View Status**: See which files, directories, or projects are currently being analyzed
- **Prevent Duplicates**: Automatically prevents multiple analyses of the same target
- **Left-Click Action Menu**: Click any active analysis to open its action menu with details, browser access, export, and close options
- **Easy Cleanup**: Close analyses you no longer need to free system resources
- **Session Details**: View detailed information about each active analysis
- **Browser Integration**: Open analyses directly in your browser
- **Export a self-contained copy**: Exporting opens a selector where you choose what travels: the normal analysis (always included), the dependency graph (generated during export if you never opened it), and the two git analyses. Picking those pre-analyzes the whole git timeline (up to 240 revisions, shared between both modes, cancellable; it can take a while on big repositories) so the copy is fully interactive offline: serve it with any static HTTP server (`npx serve`) and you can compare ANY two exported revisions and generate ANY movie (Auto, Range or Manual) without CodeXR behind it. A `README-EXPORT.md` inside the copy explains the details

## Configuration and Customization

### Analysis Settings
Access settings directly from the tree view or VS Code preferences:

- **Default Analysis Mode**: Choose between LivePanel and XR as your default
- **Deep Analysis Settings**: Configure default behavior for directory and project analysis
- **Debounce Timing**: Adjust how quickly analysis responds to code changes
- **Auto-analysis**: Enable/disable automatic re-analysis on file save
- **File Filtering**: Configure which file types to include/exclude from analysis
- **Cross-network Connections**: Enable or disable remote access on your servers (on by default; disabling stops every tunnel and removes the `cloudflared` copy CodeXR downloaded). Declining the one-time `cloudflared` download turns this off too, so you are asked again only once you re-enable it.

### XR Environment Settings
Customize your scene:

- **Chart Types**: Bars, cylinders, bubbles, boats, and more visualization options
- **Color Palettes**: Business, Blues, Commerce, Flat, Foxy, and other professional themes
- **Environment Themes**: Forest, Dream, City, Space, and more immersive backgrounds
- **Dimension Mapping**: Customize what metrics map to 3D dimensions and colors
- **Performance Settings**: Adjust rendering quality for your hardware

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **VS Code**: Version 1.98.0 or higher

## Support, Feedback & Community

### A note on VR hardware

This release was validated on desktop browsers, through CodeXR's automated test suites (unit tests, Python analysis suites and browser harnesses), **and end to end on emulated WebXR sessions** using Meta's [Immersive Web Emulator](https://github.com/meta-quest/immersive-web-emulator). That emulator is what let us find and fix real immersive bugs before shipping: entry height and positioning, what AR hides and keeps (environment, room walls, invisible colliders), stick locomotion and flight, laser aim and hand switching, AR lighting, and grabbing screens with the controller. It still **could not be tested on a physical VR headset**: everything is built on standard WebXR/A-Frame bindings and should work, so if you run CodeXR on real hardware and anything misbehaves (the [manual VR/AR checklist](docs/xr-testing/XR_MANUAL_CHECKLIST.md) is a good script to follow), **please [open an issue](https://github.com/aMonteSl/CodeXR/issues)**: a device name and a couple of lines about what went wrong are enough, and every report directly improves the next release.
